As developers, we all enjoy the efficiency improvements brought by AI coding. But to be honest, AI coding costs are indeed not low—especially when you need to frequently use top-tier models like Claude, GPT, etc. The costs of directly purchasing APIs can quickly accumulate.

If you need to use AI heavily every day to write code, review, and debug, API costs for a month could easily exceed $100. What's more frustrating is that you may have already subscribed to Claude Pro ($20/month) or ChatGPT Plus ($20/month), but when using other tools, you still need to purchase APIs separately.

TalkCody helps you dramatically reduce your AI coding costs through 3 strategies:

---

## Strategy 1: Reuse Your Existing Subscriptions

This is the most direct and cost-effective solution. If you've already subscribed to Claude Pro/Max, ChatGPT Plus/Pro, or GitHub Copilot, you can directly reuse these subscriptions through TalkCody with **zero additional cost**.

### 1.1 Claude Pro/Max Subscription Reuse

If you've already subscribed to Claude Pro ($20/month) or Claude Max ($100-200/month), through TalkCody's official OAuth authentication, you can directly use the quota within your subscription.

**How to use:**
1. Open TalkCody Settings → API Keys → Anthropic (Claude)
2. Click "Sign in with Claude"
3. Complete authorization in the browser and paste the authorization code
4. Start using Claude Sonnet, Claude Opus, and other models

**Advantages:**
- No need to purchase additional APIs, use existing subscriptions
- Real-time usage dashboard to monitor 5-hour and 7-day usage
- Automatic token refresh, no need to log in repeatedly

### 1.2 ChatGPT Plus/Pro Subscription Reuse

Similarly, if you've already subscribed to ChatGPT Plus ($20/month) or ChatGPT Pro ($200/month), you can also directly reuse through TalkCody.

**How to use:**
1. Open TalkCody Settings → API Keys → OpenAI
2. Click "Sign in with OpenAI"
3. Complete authorization in the browser
4. Start using GPT-5.2, GPT-5.2-Codex, and other models

**Advantages:**
- Reuse existing subscriptions, no additional API costs
- Use the latest GPT-5.2 series models
- Automatic token refresh for a smooth experience

### 1.3 GitHub Copilot Subscription Reuse

GitHub Copilot is also a great choice, especially if you're already using Copilot.

**How to use:**
1. Open TalkCody Settings → API Keys → GitHub Copilot
2. Click "Sign in with GitHub"
3. Enter user code in the browser to complete authorization
4. Ensure GitHub Copilot model features are enabled

**Advantages:**
- GitHub Copilot can access top-tier models like Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, etc.

## Strategy 2: Use Coding Plan Cost-Effective Solution

Coding Plan is a **coding-specific subscription plan** provided by MiniMax, Zhipu AI, and Moonshot, designed specifically for high-frequency coding scenarios. Compared to direct API billing, it can save significant costs.

### 2.1 What is Coding Plan?

Coding Plan providers and their supported models:

| Model | Provider | Features |
|------|----------|----------|
| MiniMax M2.1 | MiniMax | High-performance Chinese large model |
| GLM 4.7 | Zhipu AI | Optimized for coding |
| Kimi (K2) | Moonshot | Moonshot reasoning model |

These models have dedicated Coding Plan API endpoints optimized for programming tasks.

### 2.2 Coding Plan Advantages

Compared to purchasing APIs directly, Coding Plan has obvious advantages:

**1. Extremely Cost-Effective**
- Subscription mode, fixed cost, unlimited calls
- Save 50-80% costs in high-frequency usage scenarios compared to pay-as-you-go billing

**2. Programming Task Optimization**
